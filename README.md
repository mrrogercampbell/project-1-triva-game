My Trivia Game was built with the follow technologies:
JavaScript
Bootstrap 4
SCSS


During my initial blueprint drafting of this game my main focus was to build this out only utilizing JavaScript. JavaScript seems like such a dynamic tool and I wanted to test it for a test drive. All of my content is generation via functions. 

You must be using an up-to-date web browser (Chrome, FireFox, Edge, etc) to run this game. 

I ran into quite a few issues with DOM Minipulation. The main one being removing and creating content. When it comes to transiting from one question to the next I wanted player to be able to select an answer and if give them a prompt stating wether or not they got the question right. Then once they click and ackowndlged the prompt the DOM would remove the question and answer selection and create the next question and answer. I used a for in loop to create the different answers button which is think is part of the problem. i am not a 100% sure.

The next issue I ran into was my over all styling. But the lack of styling was more so due to me running out of time. I spent way more time than I should have on my JavaScript. 

My final unsolved issue is how to go about ending the game. As of now, when a play answers the finial question the game just stops I want to set up a function that will handle this end game logic.
